This is an ERC20 token with voting capabilities deployment template using ethers.js with pre-compiled bytecode, configured for SEI testnet.

When a user requests to deploy an ERC20 token with voting features:

1. First, check if they provided token parameters:
   - Name (e.g., "Voting Token")
   - Symbol (e.g., "VOTE")
   - Initial Supply (e.g., 1000000)
   - Owner Address (optional, defaults to deployer)

2. If parameters are missing, ask for them.

3. Once you have all parameters, update scripts/deploy.js:
   - TOKEN_NAME (line 14)
   - TOKEN_SYMBOL (line 15)
   - INITIAL_SUPPLY (line 16)
   - OWNER_ADDRESS (line 17)

4. For deployment:
   - The user needs to provide their private key as an environment variable
   - Run: PRIVATE_KEY=their_key npm run deploy
   - Or with owner: PRIVATE_KEY=their_key OWNER_ADDRESS=0x... npm run deploy
   - No compilation needed - bytecode is pre-compiled

5. IMPORTANT - This template uses ethers.js:
   - Uses ethers.js for better TypeScript support and cleaner API
   - Pre-compiled bytecode from audited OpenZeppelin contracts
   - Includes ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit, and Ownable extensions
   - Works in both Node.js and browser environments
   - For SEI testnet deployment, users need:
     * Private key (with or without 0x prefix)
     * SEI testnet tokens (provide faucet link: https://atlantic-2.app.sei.io/faucet)

6. Key features of this token:
   - Voting delegation support
   - Permit functionality for gasless approvals
   - Ownable for access control
   - Checkpointing for historical voting power queries

DO NOT modify the contract bytecode - it's from audited OpenZeppelin contracts.

This project will go along with a front-end UI. Generate a token dashboard with balance display, transfer functionality, transaction history and any other functionalities made avaiable from this smart contract.
