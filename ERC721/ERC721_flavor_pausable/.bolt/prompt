This is an ERC721 NFT with pausable functionality deployment template using Web3.js with pre-compiled bytecode, configured for SEI testnet.

When a user requests to deploy an ERC721 NFT with pausable features:

1. First, check if they provided NFT parameters:
   - Name (e.g., "My NFT Collection")
   - Symbol (e.g., "MNFT")
   - Owner Address (optional, defaults to deployer)

2. If parameters are missing, ask for them.

3. Once you have all parameters, update scripts/deploy.js:
   - NFT_NAME (line 14)
   - NFT_SYMBOL (line 15)
   - OWNER_ADDRESS (line 16)

4. For deployment:
   - The user needs to provide their private key as an environment variable
   - Run: PRIVATE_KEY=their_key npm run deploy
   - Or with owner: PRIVATE_KEY=their_key OWNER_ADDRESS=0x... npm run deploy
   - No compilation needed - bytecode is pre-compiled

5. IMPORTANT - This template is designed for webcontainers:
   - Uses Web3.js
   - Pre-compiled bytecode from audited OpenZeppelin contracts
   - Includes Pausable and Ownable extensions
   - Works in browser-based environments
   - For SEI testnet deployment, users need:
     * Private key (without 0x prefix)
     * SEI testnet tokens (provide faucet link: https://atlantic-2.app.sei.io/faucet)

6. Key features of this NFT:
   - Pausable functionality (owner can pause/unpause transfers)
   - Ownable for access control
   - Auto-incrementing token IDs
   - safeMint function for secure minting

DO NOT modify the contract bytecode - it's from audited OpenZeppelin contracts.

After successful deployment, show the user:
- Contract address
- NFT features enabled (pausable, ownable)
- Explorer link: https://testnet.seistream.app/contracts/CONTRACT_ADDRESS
